        Copy `inventory.dll` to `../stockify_app_flutter/lib/`.
    -   **For Linux:**
        ```bash
        go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libinventory.so src/main.go
        ```
        Copy `libinventory.so` to `../stockify_app_flutter/lib/`.
    -   **For macOS:**
        ```bash
        go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libinventory.dylib src/main.go
        ```
        Copy `libinventory.dylib` to `../stockify_app_flutter/lib/`.

    After building, navigate back to the root of the `Stockify` project.

3.  **Install Flutter Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the Flutter application directory and get the dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ../stockify_app_flutter
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Running the Application
